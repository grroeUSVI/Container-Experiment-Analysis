This project is exploring the outplant monitoring data from the large trees out at range cay. These were outplanted after the nursery container experiment that Zach ran as a part of an undergraduate project. 

I annotated the steps pretty well while I worked on cleaning this data, if you have data you need to clean/analyze and dont know where to start check this out for inspo.

This also merges intake data with epicotyl heights taken during initial monitoring, that transition to total heights and has early visualizations of the data
          plots total height, number of leaves, growth rate by treatment

          Started trying to explore fitting exponential growth models, and using mixed effects models unsuccessfully


          Also includes a record of some cleaning done to the nursery data for this experiment in excel, and some inital exploration of the nursery data
